# odin-landing-page

The second project of The Odin Project, a landing page.

Notes after "finishing": I certainly thought it would be less complicated. I had been learning HTML and CSS for some time and then I started using React, Next, Typescript and Tailwind to build things. So I decided to go back to the fundamentals and master the basics. React and Tailwind are really helpful :)
